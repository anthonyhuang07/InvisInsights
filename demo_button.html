    <h1>The Button™</h1>
    <h3>The most useless usefull button ever conceived.</h3>
    <p>
      At long last, the humble button has been elevated to its final form. Crafted
      from military‑grade alloys and infused with cutting‑edge technology usually
      reserved for supercomputers and space probes, The Button™ is a triumph
      of engineering excess. It does everything a button can — and everything
      it absolutely does not need to.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Engineering Beyond Reason</h2>
    <p>
      Beneath its machined titanium cap lies a labyrinth of components so
      elaborate they should require a license to operate. Our patented
      <strong>TactileForce™ Hyper‑Press Mechanism</strong> ensures each press is met with
      perfectly weighted feedback derived from a thousand lab‑tested
      simulations. A bespoke <strong>QuantumClick™ Actuator Array</strong> translates your
      intention into 1.5&nbsp;teraflops of click processing power, harnessing
      quantum‑entanglement algorithms to anticipate a press before it even
      happens.
    </p>
    <img class="content-image" src="images/exploded.png" alt="Exploded view of the Button™ showing absurdly complex internal components">
    <p>
      Every layer serves a purpose — even if that purpose is to reassure you
      that you own a button with more parts than a commercial airliner.

  <!-- Built‑in Nano RTX GPU -->
  <section class="section" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;">
    <h2>Built‑in Nano RTX™ GPU</h2>
    <p>
      Forget microcontrollers; The Button™ houses a dedicated GPU
      comparable to those found in professional workstations. This
      <em>Nano RTX™ GPU</em> is liquid cooled using our <strong>CryoCool™ Thermal System</strong>,
      maintaining peak performance while handling real‑time click simulation,
      advanced shading for the LED ring, and ray‑traced reflections for your
      viewing pleasure. Benchmark after benchmark proves our button can
      render a click in 8K at 240&nbsp;FPS — because nothing less would do.

          Powering this silicon marvel is a custom <strong>Quad‑Core Processor Board</strong>
          that orchestrates every subsystem with military precision. We could
          have stopped at just one compute core, but where's the fun in that?
        </p>
        <p>
          For developers, the onboard GPU opens up endless possibilities:
          simulate button presses across a distributed neural network; render
          photorealistic click animations; or mine blockchains between user
          interactions. The GPU is yours to harness — assuming you read all
          12,000 pages of our SDK documentation.

  <!-- Instant Heart Rate Monitoring -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Instant Heart Rate Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      Because why not? Our <strong>PulseScan™ Sensor Array</strong> continuously monitors
      your biometric signals with medical‑grade precision as you interact with
      the Button™. By pressing the Button™, you consent to having your
      heart rhythm analysed by our proprietary neural network, which uses
      deep‑learning algorithms to compare your vitals against a database of
      elite athletes. Receive real‑time feedback on your wellness and adjust
      your click cadence accordingly.
    </p>
    <img class="content-image" src="images/heart_rate.png" alt="Heart rate monitoring sensors inside the Button™">
    <p>
      Rest assured, all biometric data is stored in a quantum‑encrypted cache
      within The Button™ itself and can only be decoded by signing a waiver.

  <!-- Military‑Grade Features -->
  <section class="section" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;">
    <h2>Military‑Grade Features</h2>
    <p>
      We took the phrase “built like a tank” as both inspiration and
      instruction. The Button™ is tested to survive conditions far more
      extreme than you will ever encounter on your desk. Each feature below
      represents overkill engineering at its finest.

      Additional protective measures include an integrated <strong>Active Thermal Shield</strong>
      that dissipates heat via micro‑vapor chambers, a <strong>Shock Dampening Buffer</strong>
      developed for seismic resilience, and <strong>Biohazard Sealing</strong> rated for Level 4
      contamination. If the world ends, the Button™ will still be ready
      when you are.

  <!-- QuantumClick™ Actuator Array -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>QuantumClick™ Actuator Array</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional buttons rely on simple springs. The Button™’s
      <strong>QuantumClick™ Actuator Array</strong> uses a matrix of nano‑coils and
      micro‑pistons calibrated by AI to deliver perfectly tuned force curves.
      Each click is sampled at 96&nbsp;kHz and analysed for nuances in pressure
      application. Should your press deviate by more than 0.1&nbsp;newton, the
      array instantly compensates to keep tactile feedback consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To develop this technology, our engineers studied the biomechanics of
      concert pianists and the orbital mechanics of neutron stars. The result
      is a click so exquisitely balanced that it could only be described as
      unnecessary perfection.

  <!-- Overkill Connectivity & AI -->
  <section class="section" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;">
    <h2>Overkill Connectivity &amp; AI</h2>
    <p>
      The Button™ connects to everything. With integrated Wi‑Fi 7,
      Bluetooth LE 5.5, Li‑Fi photon transceivers and low‑earth orbit
      satellite uplink, your button remains in sync with our cloud when the
      rest of the world goes offline. A built‑in <strong>Neural Co‑Pilot</strong>
      analyses your clicking habits, predicts your next move and offers
      suggestions via subtle haptic cues. If you forget to click, it will
      click for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our <strong>ButtonOS™ 15</strong> runs on a hardened UNIX kernel with triple‑redundant
      secure enclaves. Regular firmware updates deliver new features such as
      <em>Auto‑Clicker Pro</em>, <em>Click‑to‑Earn</em> reward programs and <em>Quantum
      Randomness Generator</em>. Future updates are guaranteed for the next
      decade.

  <!-- Why stop here? -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why Stop at Just Clicking?</h2>
    <p>
      The Button™ isn’t just about pressing — it’s about possibility. Use
      the onboard sensors to track your stress levels mid‑click; leverage the
      GPU to render 3D models of your click trajectory; or harness the
      military‑grade secure enclave to store secret messages in Morse code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corporate clients can integrate the Button™ into aerospace
      cockpits, nuclear launch consoles or the coffee machine. Our advanced
      API supports voice commands, gesture recognition and even mind‑link
      control via optional neural interface (sold separately). When we say
      there is nothing else like it, we mean it.
